/**
The BOOTID.UPNP.ORG header field represents the boot instance of the device expressed according to
a monotonically increasing value. Its field value MUST be a non-negative 31-bit integer; ASCII
encoded, decimal, without leading zeros (leading zeroes, if present, MUST be ignored by the
recipient) that MUST be increased on each initial announce of the UPnP device or MUST be the same
as the field value of the NEXTBOOTID.UPNP.ORG header field in the last sent SSDP update message.
Its field value MUST remain the same on all periodically repeated announcements. A convenient
mechanism is to set this field value to the time that the device sends its initial announcement,
expressed as seconds elapsed since midnight January 1, 1970; for devices that have a notion of
time, this will not require any additional state to remember or be “flashed”. However, it is
perfectly acceptable to use a simple boot counter that is incremented on every initial announcement
as a field value of this header field. As such, control points MUST NOT view this header field as
a timestamp. The BOOTID.UPNP.ORG header field MUST be included in all announcements of a root
device, its embedded devices and its services. Unless the device explicitly updates its value by
sending an SSDP update message, as long as the device remains available in the network, the same
BOOTID.UPNP.ORG field value MUST be used in all announcements, search responses, update messages
and eventually bye-bye messages.

one advertisement that is still valid from a root device, any of its embedded devices or any of
its services, then the control point can assume that all are available. The number of seconds
